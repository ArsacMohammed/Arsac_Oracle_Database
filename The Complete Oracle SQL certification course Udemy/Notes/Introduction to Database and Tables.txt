The Complete Oracle SQL Certification Course

**Lesson**: Introduction to Databases and Oracle Ecosystem

1. **What is a Database?**:
   - A database is a repository for storing data over the long term.
   - Data within a database is structured in tables, consisting of rows (records) and columns (attributes).

2. **Table Structure**:
   - Tables have a set of columns that define the attributes.
   - Rows contain records with specific data.
   - Each column has a designated data type and should only contain data of that type.

3. **SQL (Structured Query Language)**:
   - SQL is a standardized language used for interacting with databases.
   - SQL commands are instructions given to a database to perform tasks like data retrieval, deletion, or updates.

4. **Working with Tables**:
   - SQL can be used to create, modify, and delete tables in a database.

5. **Queries**:
   - Queries are questions posed to a database to retrieve specific data.
   - Writing queries is a fundamental skill in SQL.

6. **SQL Standard**:
   - SQL is a standardized language and works across various database management systems.
   - SQL code written for one database system can often be adapted for others.

7. **Oracle Database**:
   - Oracle is a robust and powerful database management system.
   - It can be installed on dedicated servers for enterprise use.

8. **Oracle Cloud**:
   - Oracle offers a cloud-based solution called Oracle Cloud, providing instances of the Oracle database.
   - Users can access the Oracle Cloud database remotely, making it accessible from anywhere.

9. **Apex (SQL Command Editor)**:
   - Apex is a web-based tool for developing Oracle applications and writing SQL commands.
   - It is accessible through web browsers, making it platform-independent.

**Key Concepts**:

- Databases are designed to store data, structured within tables composed of rows and columns.
- SQL is a standardized language for issuing commands to interact with databases.
- SQL commands instruct databases to perform various tasks such as data retrieval or modification.
- Queries are used to retrieve specific data from a database.
- Oracle is a robust database system that can be installed on dedicated servers.
- Oracle Cloud offers a cloud-based version of the Oracle database, accessible remotely.
- Apex is a web-based SQL command editor, making it accessible through web browsers.

**Note**: This course will cover a wide range of Oracle SQL topics, including querying databases, creating and modifying tables, and working with data. Additionally, it will prepare students for Oracle SQL certification exams.
